# OB-MultiWOZ dataset

## Data Files
Training set:
- multiwoz_train_from_dstc9.jsonl: This file only contains TOD turns.
- multiwoz_train_from_dstc9_plus_ans_turns.jsonl: This file contains TOD turns and answerable QA turns.
- multiwoz_train_from_dstc9_plus_unans_turns_gpt_knowledge.jsonl: This file contains TOD turns and unanswerable QA turns. The knowledge for unanswerable questions is generated by using GPT-3 as knowledge base.
- multiwoz_train_from_dstc9_plus_unans_turns_gpt_response.jsonl: This file contains TOD turns and unanswerable QA turns. The knowledge for unanswerable questions is generated by using GPT-3 as policy model.

Validation set:
- multiwoz_val_from_dstc9.jsonl: This file only contains TOD turns.
- multiwoz_val_from_dstc9_plus_ans_turns.jsonl: This file contains TOD turns and answerable QA turns.
- multiwoz_val_from_dstc9_plus_unans_turns_gpt_knowledge.jsonl: This file contains TOD turns and unanswerable QA turns. The knowledge for unanswerable questions is generated by using GPT-3 as knowledge base.
- multiwoz_val_from_dstc9_plus_unans_turns_gpt_response.jsonl: This file contains TOD turns and unanswerable QA turns. The knowledge for unanswerable questions is generated by using GPT-3 as policy model.

Test set:
- multiwoz_test_from_dstc9.jsonl: This file only contains TOD turns.
- multiwoz_test_from_dstc9_qa_turns.jsonl: This file contains answerable QA turns.
- multiwoz_test_from_dstc9_unans_turns.jsonl: This file contains unanswerable QA turns.

## Data Format
Each record contains the following features:
- **Context** - The dialog context, including history and the current user turn.
- **Response** - The system response.
- **Knowledge** - Generated knowledge.
- **Selected_knowledge** - The selected knowledge for response generation. It can be database results, search engine retrieval results, and knowledge generated by GPT-3.
- **Id** - The record id.
- **Task** - TOD or QA.
- **Query** - The query for knowledge acquisition. It can be belief states or search queries.
