# OPERA:  Harmonizing Task-Oriented Dialogs and Information Seeking Experience

This repository is for the paper [OPERA: Harmonizing Task-Oriented Dialogs and Information Seeking Experience](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3623381)

In this work, we propose a new task, Open-Book TOD (OB-TOD), which combines TOD with QA and expands the external knowledge sources to include both explicit sources (e.g., the web) and implicit sources (e.g., pre-trained language models). We create a new dataset OB-MultiWOZ, where we enrich TOD sessions with QA-like information-seeking experience grounded on external knowledge. We propose a unified model OPERA (***Op***en-book ***E***nd-to-end Task-o***r***iented Di***a***log) which can appropriately access explicit and implicit external knowledge to tackle the OB-TOD task. Experimental results show that OPERA outperforms closed-book baselines, highlighting the value of both types of knowledge
